# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
#It iterates from num 1 to 19 to implement code inside it
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
#When range is changed to 21 instead of 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
#change end of range to be 21 instead of 20
